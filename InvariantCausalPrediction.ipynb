    "# Invariant Causal Prediction\n",

    "This notebook aims to give you a basic understanding of invariant causal prediction for causal inference. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The method's goal is as follows: Suppose we are given data $(\\mathbf{X}_1, Y_1), \\ldots, (\\mathbf{X}_n, Y_n)$ from a target variable $Y$ and a vector of $d$ predictors $\\mathbf{X}$. We are then trying to determine the causal parents $\\operatorname{pa}(Y) \\subseteq \\{1, \\ldots, d\\}$ of $Y$. The inference will be based on heterogeneity in the data (e.g., the data come from different interventional settings)."

Assume further that none of the interventions occurs directly on the variable $Z^0$. Then, for $Y:=Z^0$ and $\\mathbf{X}:=(Z^1,\\dots,Z^d)$ we have following invariance: There exists $\\beta\\in(\\mathbb{R}\\setminus\\{0\\})^{|\\operatorname{pa}(Y)|}$ such that for all $i\\in\\{1,\\dots,n\\}$\n",
